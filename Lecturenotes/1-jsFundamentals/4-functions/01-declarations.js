/*
FUNCTIONS
*/

//GeneralIdeas: at their broadest level, funtctions do the following:
//1) they take some input which the function will handle/process
//2) they process the input given to them
//3) they usually, but not always return some value
//4) they can be invoked (used) as many times as we want, cutting down on code repetition



//example one: 
function newFunc(num){
  return  num + 1;
}

console.log(newFunc(7));
console.log(newFunc(10));
